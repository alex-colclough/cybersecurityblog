      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;welcome-to-my-blog&#34;&gt;Welcome to my blog!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my personal website for documenting things i have learned, advice i want to give, and have a centralized place to document things that I find interesting. Welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-me&#34;&gt;About me&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an information security professional that has had a wide range of experience throughout a variety of different information technology career fields. I started as a student help desk worker and slowly rose through the ranks. My next job was a jack of all trades role, and then I discovered my first love of system administration. I did that for 4.5 years and primarily focused on SharePoint (on-premises and SharePoint Online), active directory, Office365, Security, and a variety of other one-off projects that come about from being a system administrator.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

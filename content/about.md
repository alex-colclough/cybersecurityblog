# Welcome to my blog! 

This is my personal website for documenting things i have learned, advice i want to give, and have a centralized place to document things that I find interesting. Welcome!


# About me

I am an information security professional that has had a wide range of experience throughout a variety of different information technology career fields. I started as a student help desk worker and slowly rose through the ranks. My next job was a jack of all trades role, and then I discovered my first love of system administration. I did that for 4.5 years and primarily focused on SharePoint (on-premises and SharePoint Online), active directory, Office365, Security, and a variety of other one-off projects that come about from being a system administrator. 

After that, I focused on my first security job where i worked on mergers and acquisitions and eventually moved into a role focusing on incident response, endpoint security, and a multitude of other functions. I hope to use my experience to help guide others who are hoping to move into both IT and cyber security.

# My technical interests

Linux, ethical hacking, blue team security, system administration, and coaching/helping others to grow to their highest potential.
